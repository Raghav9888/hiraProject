                    <h4 class="fw-bold   text-green mb-3">Radical Reimagining & Reactivating</h4>
                    <p>We believe healing isn’t one-size-fits-all. At Hira, we’re reclaiming our natural ways of being - reawakening ancestral wisdom while embracing modern tools that support us. We honor both where we come from and where we’re going.</p>
                    <p>Because we’re building something new, we’re also learning as we go - with grace, transparency, and humility. This is not about perfection, but about showing up with care and courage as we forge a new path forward.</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">We don’t just speak it. We build it.</p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold   text-green mb-3">We’ve asked over 900 people - seekers and practitioners - about their pain points and needs. </h4>
                    <p>We’ve designed Hira in response to those truths. Our monthly practitioner check-ins have guided every part of the 2.5-year development process.</p>
                    <p>Our platform intentionally uplifts interdependence over individualism - through practitioner-to-practitioner endorsements and community-rooted visibility.</p>
                    <p>Even behind the scenes, we live our values. Our women-led team works through a 28-day cyclical workflow that honors our bodies, energy, and spiritual rhythms - guided by a matriarchal lens of leadership and care.</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">We don’t just speak it. We build it.</p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold   text-green mb-3">Restoration</h4>
                    <p>Wellness has been commercialized and colonized - but not here. Hira is a space of return: a space to restore what’s been taken, to purify what’s been distorted, and to build a community rooted in dignity, reverence, and interdependence.</p>
                    <p>We know this work is complex. We don’t claim to have all the answers - but we remain committed to integrity, evolution, and the values that brought us here.</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">We don’t just speak it. We build it.</p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold   text-green mb-3">Communal Archaeology</h4>
                    <p>We believe in remembering together. Through shared exploration, we revive and protect ancestral healing practices - with deep respect, not appropriation. This is about honoring lineages, amplifying cultural wisdom, and practicing with reverence and responsibility.</p>
                    <p>We don’t perform accountability - we live it. Through dialogue, care, and curiosity, we show up in the work of doing better.</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">We don’t just speak it. We build it.</p>


                    <h4 class="fw-bold   text-green mb-3">Our vetting process is one of the most thorough in the wellness space:</h4>
                    <p>We pre-screen, interview, check references, and observe a practice session. Practitioners are chosen not just for what they do, but for how they do it.</p>
                    <p>Vetting doesn’t stop after onboarding. Through reviews, ratings, and community feedback, we continue to hold every practitioner to a high standard - not to police, but to protect what’s sacred.</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">We don’t just speak it. We build it.</p>


                    <p>We uplift lineage-rooted practitioners, create space for cultural storytelling, and center ethical practice in everything we do.</p>
                    <p>Our platform offers opportunities for community gatherings, events, and collective rituals - because healing isn’t a solo journey.</p>
                    <p>Our Collective Shelf-Care library - filled with blogs, videos, reflections, and teachings - offers ongoing space for shared learning, remembering, and repair.</p>

                    <h4 class="fw-bold   text-green mb-3">Interconnected Growth</h4>
                    <p>Healing doesn’t happen in isolation. At Hira, we grow together - supporting one another, learning from one another, and creating space for collective transformation.</p>
                    <p>We don’t subscribe to cancel culture, but we also don’t bypass harm. We believe in boundaries with compassion, and accountability rooted in care. We’re not here to perform perfection - we’re here to practice presence.</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">We don’t just speak it. We build it.</p>

                    <p>Our support system is powered by humans, not bots - and our community is held with warmth, responsiveness, and relationship.</p>
                    <p>We’ve created space for collective reflection, monthly check-ins, and ongoing peer connection - not only for those seeking healing, but for those offering it.</p>
                    <p>Our quarterly practitioner retreats, community gatherings, and private spaces for practitioners ensure that our healers are nourished, seen, and held.</p>
                    <p>At Hira, growth means walking together - through joy, discomfort, learning, and repair. Everyone is part of the ecosystem.</p>

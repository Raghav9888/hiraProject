                <h2>Our Land Acknowledgement</h2>
                <div class="p-4">
                    <p>
                        The Hira Collective acknowledges that we are created, built, and operating on lands that have long
                        been home to Indigenous Peoples, including the Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, Huron-Wendat, Métis, and
                        many others whose stories, cultures, and stewardship have shaped these lands since time immemorial.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We recognize that what is now called Canada exists on stolen land, and we carry a lifelong
                        responsibility to listen, learn, and take meaningful action toward justice, truth, and
                        reconciliation. <strong>Wellness is not separate from justice. Healing is not separate from truth. Growth is
                            not separate from accountability.</strong> The Hira Collective stands in solidarity with Indigenous
                        communities, honoring the past, transforming the present, and building a future that is deeply
                        rooted in respect, reciprocity, and the right relationship with the land and all its peoples.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Honoring the roots of this land means committing to truth, reciprocity, and lifelong learning. It
                        means showing up—imperfectly, humbly, and with a willingness to listen. <em>Colonialism thrives on the
                            pursuit of ‘rightness’ and perfection, and we reject that.</em> We know we will not always get it right,
                        but we believe that healing, justice, and reconciliation require action, even in the discomfort of
                        not knowing the perfect way forward.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a collective dedicated to holistic healing, we recognize that wellness is inseparable from
                        justice, and healing is inseparable from truth. We are committed to uplifting Indigenous voices,
                        integrating cultural integrity into all that we do, and actively working toward a future that honors
                        the wisdom, sovereignty, and rights of Indigenous Peoples.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We invite our community to join us in this process—not just in words, but in action. We encourage
                        continued reflection, learning, and engagement with Indigenous-led movements for land back, equity,
                        and healing.
                    </p>

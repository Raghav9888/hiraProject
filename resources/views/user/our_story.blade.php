                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <div class="p-4">
                            <p><strong>The Hira Collective</strong> was born at the sacred intersection of ancestral wisdom, lived experience, and a longing for something more honest in the wellness world.</p>

                            <h5 style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: center">A Seed Planted in Legacy</h5>
                            <p>Nine years ago, just a week before my grandmother, <strong>Popati Hiranandani</strong>, passed away, the seed for Hira was planted. I had just returned from an ashram, completing my yoga certification, hopeful about what ethical healing spaces could be. But that hope sat beside a deeper truth I couldn’t ignore—the harm I had witnessed in other spaces.</p>

                            <p>I grew up surrounded by healing spaces that weren’t always safe. I saw sacred practices being watered down, sold back to us, and stripped of meaning. I saw unethical practitioners take advantage of people’s vulnerability. And later, as an educator and equity leader, I saw the same dynamics play out: power hoarded, culture commodified, and care reduced to performance.</p>

                            <h5 style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: center">Turning Grief Into Purpose</h5>
                            <p>After my grandmother’s passing, I couldn’t bring myself to create the platform. The grief was too raw. But over time, that grief transformed into clarity. And clarity became a calling.</p>
                            <p>Three years ago, I shared the idea with my <strong>Mama, Partab Hiranandani</strong>, and he looked at me and said: <em>“You must do this.”</em> His words felt like a divine assignment. Hira became a way to honor them both—and something bigger.</p>

                            <h5 style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: center">The Road Was Not Smooth</h5>
                            <p>There were setbacks. People who tried to copy the idea. Developers who disappeared. Promises made and broken. Launch dates that had to be released when life got in the way.</p>
                            <p>But there were also signs. The two first practitioners I pitched said <em>yes</em> without hesitation. An intuitive coach, a spiritual counselor, and a psychic helped guide me to the right team. And today, I walk with a team of six—brilliant, aligned, heart-centered humans who make this work possible.</p>

                            <h5 style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: center">The Meaning of Hira</h5>
                            <p>Our name reflects a legacy. <strong>Popati</strong> means butterfly—a symbol of transformation, softness, and becoming. <strong>Hira</strong> means diamond—a symbol of clarity, strength, and wholeness. But the diamond also holds a complicated truth—historically tied to colonial extraction and the commodification of culture.</p>
                            <p>At Hira, we reclaim it. We transform it into a symbol of ancestral sovereignty, sacred worth, and unshakeable light.</p>

                            <h5 style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: center">Why I Created Hira</h5>
                            <p class="fw-bold">I created Hira for every version of me.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For the little girl with brown skin who never felt like she belonged.</li>
                                <li>For the teenager who lay in bed wondering if it would ever get better.</li>
                                <li>For the young woman who was lost and vulnerable, falling into the hands of unethical healers.</li>
                                <li>For the educator who saw systems perform “care” without embodying it.</li>
                                <li>For the woman told she wasn’t enough—for her skin, her voice, her hair, or her experience.</li>
                                <li>For everyone else who’s been there too.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5 style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: center">The Power of the Collective</h5>
                            <p class="fw-bold">I believe we can build something different.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>That business can be rooted in values and create abundance.</li>
                                <li>That healing is our birthright—and should be held with integrity.</li>
                                <li>That when we support one another, we rise together.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Hira is for every person still finding their way home to themselves. This is not just my healing—it’s our collective return.</p>

                        <p>
                            In the unlikely event customer data has been lost, stolen, or potentially compromised, our
                            policy is to alert our customers via email no later than 72 hours of our becoming aware of
                            the event. We will also report such incident to any required data protection authority. We
                            will work closely with any customers affected to determine next steps such as any end-user
                            notifications, needed patches, and how to avoid any similar event in the future.
